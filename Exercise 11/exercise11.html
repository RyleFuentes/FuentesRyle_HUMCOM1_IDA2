               <p>
                   Watching anime has been one of
                   my hobbies as I grew up. I was able
                   to learn lots of lessons from it and it's 
                   been one of my coping mechanisms. One of my favorites
                   are One piece, Hunter x Hunter, Reborn, etc., Anime is not
                   just as simple as fiction for me, they shaped me to become
                   who I am today.

                <p>
                    Music connects a lot of people all over the world. Nowadays
                    we use music as a medium for our various emotions.
                    Same as through with me, music has helped me release a lot of my emotions 
                    most of them are negative. Music is also my lifeline at school, with the help of it
                    I was able to get a scholarship at university.

                <p>
                    Online gaming is a big trend right now, may it be for pc, smartphone,
                    or other platforms. Games enables its players to imagine that they are living
                    in an alternate world, a world of fantasy. The reason why games is part of this list is quite simple,
                    I'm one of those people, games makes me feel more alive, and it helps me release lots of stress just by 
                    playing for a couple of hours.
