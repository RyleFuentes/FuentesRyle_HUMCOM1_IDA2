                <dd>league is one of the if not, the biggest esport title right now in the market. This game 
                    holds various tournaments that vary on each regions and servers. Basically how the game works is that,
                    at the beginning of each game, 5 players will choose different roles such as jungle, mid lane, bottom lane,
                    top lane, and lastly support. Each of these roles has their own respective uses in the game itself and it's 
                    extremely important to follow these role allocation. After choosing their roles and champions the game will
                    load and the players will be redirected into <i>Summoner's Rift</i>, the map or platform arena where both teams
                    will face off each other.

                    The game is usually divided into three major flows which are the early game, middle game and the Late game.
                    Each of these phasees has their own respective patters. In the early game phase, each player's goal is to basically 
                    gather resources for them to become strong in the middle game phase, so they just kill a lot of <i>mobs</i>
                    that spawns in a set interval. Next is the middle game, at this phase of the game where we can see real action to 
                    take place, this part is extremely crucial because usually if you have an advantegous placement in the middle game, you 
                    will most likely win the game all throughout but of course that doesn't apply to every scenerio. And Lastly of course is the late game.
                    At this stage of the game each team should have enough resources and items to win every battle that will take place, at this stage 
                    whoever kills the other team as fast they could wins the whole thing. These are the major stages of the game and these are basically 
                    norms and standards already.

            <p>
               <dd> League of legends has a huge variety of characters that you could choose from, as stated above there are 
                5 different roles in the game namely supports, top laners, mid laners, junglers, and adr. So let's talk about 
                these roles one at a time. First are top laners, this role highlights heavy bruiser or fighter champions that
                are extremely great in 1v1 situation, these players usually are the main frontlines of each team. Next are mid laners,
                this role mainly focuses on mage and assassin type of champions, they are the ones responsible for nipping enemies one at a time
                and they usually deal insane amount of damage. Next in line are the junglers, this role is one of the most difficult
                roles to play in the game, basically if you play this role you need to roam the map from top to bottom to make sure 
                that your allies could become stronger with your help, this role is also responsible for killing monsters in the jungle.
                These monsters has a lot of useful buffs and effects that may boosts your chances of winning the game. The next one is the adc/adr role.
                Adc stands for <i>"attack damage carry"</i>, as the name implies this role is the one mainly responsible for dealing heavy 
                damage to your enemies, they can sustainly deal huge amount of damage throughout the game but the drawback is that they are 
                extremely easy to kill, and that where our last role comes in, supports. Support is a special role, they don't have 
                strong damage amount as compares to the previous roles discussed but they can support their adc's so that they don't die easily 
                this role affect the game as a whole due to the fact that characters that are used in this role tend to have a lot of utility, 
                they can either be extremely tough champions also called <i>tanks</i>, or they can be utility supports who can heal and 
                shield their allies.

                    an interesting backstories and world building around it's character, the developers and designers
                    are extremely innovatinve and active with their players and that makes the game extremely fun and 
                    positive. However just like other games out there, League of Legends is not perfect either, one of it's 
                    flaws is that it's player community are extremely toxic towards each other, This leads to trash talking, 
                    bullying, and boosting in a lot of areas. Due to it's extreme popularity a lot of people plays it and
