                <p> In college, Farhan and Raju form a great bond with Rancho due to his positive and refreshing outlook to life. Years later, a bet gives them a chance to look 
                    for their long-lost friend whose existence seems rather elusive. </p>
                <p>The main reason why this is within my top 5 movies of all time is quite simple, it taught me 
                    the simplicity in life, that I shouldn't over complicate things around me. Overall this movie 
                    left a big impression on me.

            <p>From director Makoto Shinkai, the innovative mind behind Voices of a Distant Star and 5 Centimeters Per Second, comes a beautiful masterpiece about time, the thread of fate, and the hearts of two young souls. The day the stars fell, two lives changed forever. High-schoolers Mitsuha and Taki are complete strangers living separate lives. But one night, they suddenly switch places. Mitsuha wakes up in Taki's body, and he in hers. This bizarre occurrence continues to happen randomly, and the two must adjust their lives around each other. Yet, somehow, it works. They build a connection and 
                communicate by leaving notes, messages, and more importantly, an imprint. When a dazzling comet lights up the night's sky, something shifts, and they seek each other out wanting something more - a chance to finally meet. But try as they might, something more daunting than distance prevents them. Is the string of fate between Mitsuha and Taki strong enough to bring them together, 
                or will forces outside their control leave them forever separated?</p>
            <p>Overall the reason why this one is in my top 4 is because it's extremely addicting to watch, from the 
                start of the show up until the end, the story is evolving to match the viewers interest.

            <p>Based on a true story about a man named Christopher Gardner. Gardner has invested heavily in a device known as a "bone density scanner". He feels like he has it made selling these devices. However, they do not sell well as they are marginally better than x-ray at a much higher price. As Gardner works to make ends meet, his wife leaves him and he loses his apartment. Forced to live out in the streets with his son,
             Gardner continues to sell bone density scanners while concurrently taking on an unpaid internship as a stockbroker, with slim chances for advancement to a paid position. Before he can receive pay, 
            he needs to outshine the competition through 6 months of training, and to sell his devices to stay afloat.</p>
            <p>This show is one of my childhood favorites. It just hits differently everytime I watch it. The characters 
                are relatable, and the situations are close to real life situations

            <p>Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Movie: Mugen Train is a follow-up to the extremely popular 
                TV series Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba (2019) that premiered in April 2019 and was based on Koyoharu Gotouge's comic, 
                which boasts over 100 million copies in circulation in Japan. Featuring animation production from revered animation studio Ufotable, the story follows Tanjiro Kamado's journey as a demon slayer after his family is brutally murdered and his sister is turned into a demon. The film opens as Tanjiro and his comrades have completed their rehabilitation training at the Butterfly Mansion, and they arrive at their next mission on the Mugen Train, where over forty people have disappeared in a very short span of time. Tanjiro and Nezuko, along with Zenitsu and Inosuke, join one of the most powerful swordsmen of the Demon Slayer Corps, 
                Flame Hashira Kyojuro Rengoku, to face the demon aboard the Mugen Train, on track to despair.</p>
            <p>The reason why this one is in my top 2 of all time is quite simple, it has extremely beautiful 
                animations, battle sequences, and the overall production is just great, the story is also not 
                lacking in anyway with its mixture of drama and comedy.

            <p>10-year-old Chihiro and her parents are riding along during a family outing through the countryside 
                when they stumble across an amusement park that has seemingly been abandoned for years. 
                Despite Chihiro's premonitions about the creepy setting, her parents explore the area and 
                eventually discover and indulge in an empty eatery filled with fresh food. 
                As a result of their unfaithfulness, they are magically turned into pigs, which in turn scares away Chihiro. She meets the enigmatic Haku, who explains to her that this land is actually a magical bath house, a kind of holiday resort, where supernatural beings seek comfort away from the earthly realm and she must work here, 
                as laziness is not permitted, to free both herself and her parents from the mystical land.</p>
            <p>This one is an absolute masterpiece. Even though the number two in this list has already taken its spot 
                as the number one anime movie of all time, it's still one of the best for me, the cinematography of this 
                show is just out of this world, with its background properly matching the characters to give more life to
                the whole show.
