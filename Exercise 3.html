    <h2 style="color: RED;">STEPS:</h2>
    <dd ><line style="color: orange;"><b>Things to keep in mind:</b></line>
        <ul>
            <li>Know the purpose of your build</li>
            <li>Know your budget limit</li>
            <li>Know the time period that you'll be needing it</li>
        </ul>

        <b style="color: hotpink;"><strong>Step by step procedure: </strong></b>
        <ol>
            <li>Unbox all the parts that you'll need</li>
            <li>Start with the motherboard, scan through the build of the motherboard</li>
            <li>Insert the processor of your choice into the CPU slot</li>
            <li>After inserting properly, connect the fan cooler</li>
            <li>Make sure to check if there's a pre-applied thermal paste in the cooler. If there's none apply some directly to the top of the processor</li>
            <li>After putting the fan in place and screwing it in, plug its connector to the motherboard.</li>
            <li>Next step is to put the RAM into the slots</li>
                <dd style="color: blue;"><i>*check the manual first usually you need to put it in a specific way or else it won't work*</i></dd>
            <li>Set up the chassis that you'll be using</li>
            <li>Make sure that the motherboard is placed properly then screw it in</li>
            <li>Place the power supply(<i>at the back usually of the chassis</i>)then select the wires that you'll need.</li>
                 <dd style="color: blue;"><i>*Normally you'll just need one connector to connect to either HDD or SSD, and one connector to the motherboard*</i></dd>
            <li>Place the physical storage that you'll be using(<i>e.g...M.2, SSD, HDD)</i></li>
            <li>Connect it to the power supply then use a SATA cable to connect it to the motherboard(<i>Not the case for M.2</i>).</li>
            <li>After all that place your GPU of choice into the motherboard</li>
                <dd style="color: blue;"><i>*This is optional because there are CPU's that comes with integrated GPU's*</i></dd>
            <li>After all of that is done you are almost done</li>
            <li>The last part is compose of software related steps the first one is to get a bootable drive and use it to install an OS to your PC</li>
            <li>Lastly check the drivers</li>
            <dd style="color: blue;"><i>*You may be required to install your drivers and chipsets manually depending on what CPU you're using*</i></dd>

        </ol>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;"><br><br>That's the end of the procedure, if you're still not comfortable building one for yourself then just go to some lock computer shops in your area</h3>
